This SFTP client supports upload, download, directory creation, and copy and paste functionality. Connections can be configured in the upper portion of the window and actions can be performed in the central portion of the screen (local machine directories on left and remote machine directories on right). Information is logged on the console in the bottom portion of the screen as the application is used.

This client is not currently available in a single executable file, but you can run this client by simply running `npm start` from the root directory of this project.
